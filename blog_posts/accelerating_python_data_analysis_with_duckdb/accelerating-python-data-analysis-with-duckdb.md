# Accelerating Python Data Analysis with DuckDB

I recently gave a talk at the Michigan Python Meetup on Python data analyis using DuckDB. The talk was recorded and is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EL1AEXrybU).

From the description of the talk:

> This presentation will introduce DuckDB and how it can speed up data analysis in Python. DuckDB is an in-process OLAP SQL database that integrates seamlessly with Python and packages like Pandas, and it allows for fast, local data processing in SQL. Weâ€™ll explore how to use it, why you might choose DuckDB over something like Pandas, and some of its other features.
