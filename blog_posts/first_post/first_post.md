This site will be a collection of notes, write-ups, projects, thought out posts, and garbage. Currently, I'm writing these posts using Obsidian.md, which is connected to the GitHub repo for this site through a plugin. Really, it's just convenient because I don't have to build or integrate some text editor and I don't have to get *too* manual with managing files

Now for the part where I show future me how to write posts for this website

# Step 1 - Folder and Text
Duplicate the folder containing this post and make sure the new folder is under 'blog_posts/'. Change the title/desc/body

# Step 2 - Images
Copy your images into the folder for the new post. The image named in the thumbnail property will be displayed on the website as a thumbnail. Copy pictures into the folder for the content of the post. Make sure the picture file names match what's written in the post

# Step 3 - Commit with Obsidian
Obsidian is configured to where I can push directly to the blog posts folder of the git repo. (Eventually) A GitHub Action will auto-run the process to display the post on the page
