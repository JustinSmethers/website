# Simplifying Python Development with uv

I recently gave a talk at the Michigan Python Meetup on simplifying Python development with uv. The talk was recorded and is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv9r99bOFPg).

From the description of the talk:

> This beginner-friendly talk will introduce a new and exciting Python package: uv. uv is a Python project and package management tool written in Rust which aims to replace pip, venv, pipx, poetry, and more. We'll talk about how to manage Python projects before uv and managing them with uv - from simple scripts to production-ready projects.
