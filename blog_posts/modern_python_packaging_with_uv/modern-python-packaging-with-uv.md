# Modern Python Packaging with uv

I recently gave a talk at the Michigan Python Meetup on modern Python packaging using uv. The talk was recorded and is available on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhiP7w_GsZQ).

From the description of the talk:

> In this talk, we'll walk through the essentials of packaging and publishing to PyPI using uv, a modern Python project and package manager that makes the process fast and painless. Whether you're looking to share a useful utility or contribute to the open-source ecosystem, you'll leave with practical knowledge of how to structure a package, add proper metadata, and push it to PyPI so others can easily install and use your code.
